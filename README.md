      + Created a “resources” page with many useful learning materials and other tools.
      + Organized the differences in return types between pydicom and dicom_parser.
    - Multi-frame Support
      + Create the MultiFrame and FunctionalGroups classes.
      + Complete coverage except for a specific Phillips-specific case for which we don’t yet have a sample file.
